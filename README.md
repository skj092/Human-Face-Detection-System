# Human-Face-Detection-System

**Objective: - Human Face Detection System**

The face detection took a major leap with deep learning techniques. We can
build models with high accuracy in detecting the bounding boxes of the human
face. This project will get you started with object detection and you will learn
how to detect any object in an image.

Face recognition technology is a subset of Object Detection that focuses on
observing the instance of semantic objects. It is designed to track and visualize
human faces within digital images.

**Task:** - Create a Web Application using FASTAPI. Use the end user should be
able to upload an image and get results with the prediction face and bounding
box coordinates. Use any 3 different algorithms. The end user should have the
choice to select the algorithm options via a dropdown in the webpage.
